# CS199

Folder: DNA Steganography
- Contains the source codes of the simulation of the Cryptosystem described by Leier et al.
- dna_encryption.py contains the source code that simulates the cryptosystem's encryption.
- plaintext.txt contains the string to be encrypted. (input of dna_encryption.py)
- ciphertext.txt contains the encrypted plaintext. (output of dna_encryption.py)
- dna_decryption.py contains the source code that simulates the cryptosystem's decryption. Prints the plaintext in the command line.

Folder: DNA Encryption with Steganography
- Contains the source codes for the simulation of the original cryptosystem by Thiruthuvadoss and the new cryptosystem that was based on it.
- crypto_thiruthuvadoss.py contains the source code that simulates the original cryptosystem.
- crypto_mod.py contains the source code that simulates the new cryptosystem.
- test_thiruthuvadoss.py is used for the testing of running time. (takes email.txt/plaintext.txt/sms.txt as input)
- test_mod.py is used for the testing of running time. (takes email.txt/plaintext.txt/sms.txt as input)
- plaintext.txt, sms.txt, and email.txt are the sample inputs to the cryptosystems

Folder: 199 FINAL PAPER
- Contains the LaTeX sources of the final paper
