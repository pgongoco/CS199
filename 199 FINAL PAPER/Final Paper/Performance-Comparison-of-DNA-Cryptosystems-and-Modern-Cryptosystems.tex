\begin{abstract}
As computers become more powerful, existing cryptosystems become vulnerable to attacks. This trend caused a nonstop attempt to improve security. Since the emergence of DNA computation, researches have focused in exploring its potential applications in cryptography due to its massive parallelism and high-density information storage. Since DNA cryptography is relatively new, the existing proposals for DNA-based cryptosystems are mainly theoretical and are still to be used in real life applications. We are developing a new and improved DNA-based cryptosystem based on an existing one. Comparative study to other modern cryptosystems (AES, etc.) will be done to determine if the new cryptosystem meet the standards of today's cryptography. Our results show that adding a layer of security through a steganographic approach proved to be impractical because of its time complexity of $O(n^2)$. This is due to the generation of random strands of DNA used to hide the ciphertext.
